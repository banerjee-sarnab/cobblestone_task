Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a weighted moving average technique that gives us more significance to the recent data points, making it highly responsive to real-time changes in a data stream. This responsiveness makes EMA effective for detecting anomalies, such as sudden spikes or drops, in dynamic environments. Unlike simple moving averages, EMA adapts quickly to fluctuations while smoothing out noise, allowing it to flag unusual deviations without being overly sensitive to random variations. Its easy to understand nature and computational efficiency, requiring only constant time updates for each new data point, makes it particularly suitable for continuous and real-time anomaly detection tasks. That's why we have chosen this over other anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest or ARIMA.
